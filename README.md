# The Hell's Jerks

Here we are

## Game design notes

Units:

- Scream
- Demon
- Lava
- Level (XP)
- Souls (and waiting souls)

Main Loop

- you need souls to punish
- punish souls and get screams
- punishment structures needs demons
- simple structures need only demons
- but many punishment machines also need lava
- demons are created with screams in special buildings
- demons work with screams. So punishment machines need screams
- lava is extracted by machines which are used by demons
- soul capacity is correlated with punishment machines
- new lava and torture machine become available with player level
- levels is increased with xp, which is correlated with screams

Extra

- tech trees for better machines
- get more souls from earth with special demons
- which also increases sin point.
- sin point can be translated into screams
- bought souls can become innovators for tech tree. Basically it is points to use in tech tree
- different demon types
- boosting fear?
